# PHASE 8: INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ENGINE

## Objective
Phase 8 ka goal ek intelligent search system banana hai jo users ko unke notes ke andar meaning-based search provide kare, using NLP + TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity instead of simple keyword matching.

---

## Features

### 1. Text Preprocessing
- Convert text to lowercase
- Tokenization (splitting into words)
- Stopword removal (common words like is, the, and)
- Lemmatization (converting words to base form)

---

### 2. TF-IDF Vectorization
Notes ko numerical vector representation me convert kiya jata hai using TF-IDF.

- TF (Term Frequency)
- IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)
- Helps identify important words in a document

---

### 3. Inverted Index
Word-to-document mapping system:

Example:
"dp" → [Note1, Note3]
"graph" → [Note2, Note5]

This helps in fast retrieval of relevant notes.

---

### 4. Cosine Similarity
User query aur stored notes ke beech similarity calculate ki jati hai.

- Higher score = more relevant note
- Used for ranking results

---

## System Workflow

User Query
↓
Text Preprocessing
↓
TF-IDF Vectorization
↓
Cosine Similarity Calculation
↓
Ranking of Notes
↓
Top Relevant Notes Returned

---

## API Endpoints

GET /api/search?q=...
→ Returns ranked notes based on similarity score

POST /api/index/rebuild
→ Rebuilds TF-IDF model from database notes

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- SQLite

---

## Outcome

Phase 8 ke baad system capable hoga:

- Smart semantic search inside notes
- Meaning-based retrieval system
- Foundation for recommendation engine
- Input layer for ML-based forgetting prediction system

---

## Summary

Phase 8 transforms the application from a simple notes storage system into an intelligent knowledge retrieval system powered by Information Retrieval techniques.
