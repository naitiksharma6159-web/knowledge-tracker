# Knowledge Decay Predictor & Smart Revision Assistant

## Project Overview

Knowledge Decay Predictor & Smart Revision Assistant is an educational web platform that helps students retain knowledge effectively through intelligent revision planning.

The system tracks study activity, predicts knowledge decay using machine learning, retrieves relevant learning resources using information retrieval techniques, and generates personalized revision schedules.

The goal is to improve long-term memory retention and reduce inefficient studying.

---

## Problem Statement

Students frequently forget concepts after studying because they do not revise consistently and lack personalized study guidance.

The platform should predict forgetting risk, identify weak topics, retrieve relevant learning material, and generate intelligent revision recommendations.

---

## Project Objectives

The system should:

1. Track student learning behavior.
2. Predict knowledge decay.
3. Identify high-risk topics.
4. Retrieve relevant revision material.
5. Generate personalized revision schedules.
6. Explain revision recommendations.
7. Improve long-term memory retention.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

Input Features:

* Days Since Last Study
* Study Duration
* Confidence Score
* Quiz Score
* Revision Count
* Topic Difficulty

Models:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

Outputs:

* Forget Risk Score
* Risk Category

* High Risk

---

## Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine should:

* Rank topics by risk
* Generate revision priorities
* Create revision schedules
* Recommend study materials

Example:

Today's Revision:

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Graph Algorithms
3. Binary Search

---

## Smart Study Assistant

The chatbot should:

* Explain risk predictions
* Explain revision recommendations
* Help users navigate the platform
* Help locate notes
* Explain study progress

Example:

User:
Why should I revise Graph Algorithms?

Assistant:
Because your confidence score is low, quiz performance is weak, and the topic has not been revised recently.
