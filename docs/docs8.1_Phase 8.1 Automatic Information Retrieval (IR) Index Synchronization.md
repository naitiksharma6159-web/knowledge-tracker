# Phase 8.1: Automatic Information Retrieval (IR) Index Synchronization

## Objective

Integrate the existing Information Retrieval engine with the Notes system so that the search index remains automatically synchronized whenever notes are created, updated, or deleted.

---

## Current Problem

The IR engine currently exists as an independent component.

Although users can upload and store notes, the search index does not automatically update after note operations.

This creates a gap between stored data and searchable data.

---

## Goals

1. Automatically rebuild the user's IR index whenever a note is created.
2. Automatically rebuild the user's IR index whenever a note is updated.
3. Automatically rebuild the user's IR index whenever a note is deleted.
4. Eliminate the need for manual index rebuilding.
5. Maintain strict user isolation.

## Integration Flow

Create Note
↓
Save To Database
↓
Rebuild User IR Index
↓
Return Success Response

Update Note
↓
Update Database
↓
Rebuild User IR Index
↓
Return Success Response

Delete Note
↓
Delete From Database
↓
Rebuild User IR Index
↓
Return Success Response

## Expected Benefits

* Search results remain current.
* Newly uploaded notes become searchable immediately.
* Deleted notes disappear from search results automatically.
* Improved user experience.
* Foundation prepared for ML pipeline integration.

---

## Success Criteria

✓ Create note → searchable immediately

✓ Update note → updated search results

✓ Delete note → removed from search results

✓ No manual rebuild endpoint required for normal usage

✓ Existing tests continue to pass

## Deliverables

* Notes service integration with IR service.
* Automatic rebuild trigger after CRUD operations.
* Updated unit tests.
* Documentation updates.
